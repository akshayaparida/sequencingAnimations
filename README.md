This project part of MDN WebDocs.

Web Animations API: this modern API to define and control animations directly in JavaScript, allowing for more dynamic and interactive web experiences.

Keyframe Animation:  learned how to define keyframes (aliceTumbling) to specify the starting and ending states of an animation, such as rotation and scaling transformations.

Timing and Control: configured animation timing (aliceTiming) with options like duration, iterations, and fill mode, influencing how animations are played out on the web page.

Asynchronous Programming: By using async and await, managed the sequential execution of animations across multiple elements (alice1, alice2, alice3), ensuring animations occur in a synchronized manner.
